# hello-world
my first repository from the tutorial

Hi any interested individuals!
<body>
  My name is Su Latt Phone, and I'm a first year college student currently.
  I'm super interested in computer science although I realized this passion pretty late.
  I know some html, css, C and C#.net. And now, starting to go into Java seriously.
